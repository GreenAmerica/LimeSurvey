# LimeSurvey + Media Queries + Compass + HTML5 Boilerplate

This is LimeSurvey template for the Green Business Assessment.

## Current status

LimeSurvey defaults to using a flat folder structure for its templates, which is extremely annoying and confusing. CSS is currently all listed in template.css and that filename is hardcoded into the files that LimeSurvey calls.

Template files also must be uploaded through the interface, and cannot be simply dropped into the template directory, which is bloody idiotic.
